/** \mainpage HRI board firmware documentation
 * \section intro_sec Introduction
 * This is the documentation of the HRI board firmware. You will find a
 * description of the provided library and drivers. As all the hardware and
 * software is very new, please do not hesitate to suggest improvements to the
 * course assistants (Evgenia Roussinova, Ozge orhan, Ali Reza Manzoori).
 *
 * \section code_struct_sec Code structure
 * The code is divided into 3 parts:
 *  - main: this is where the controllers and the communication protocol are
 * implemented. The call of all the initialization functions is also made here.
 *  - library: all the algorithms, data structures that could be used at many
 * places, are put into the library.
 *  - drivers: there is one driver per peripheral. All the hardware-specific
 * code is wrapped into these files, so that the user does not have to worry
 * about the microcontroller operation (and spend a lot of time to read the
 * documentation).
 *
 * One module (controller, communication, library or driver) is always split
 * in two files, .h and .c, like in C++.

 *
 * \section lib_how_to How to use the provided library
 * For most of the driver/library modules, call x_Init() only once, when the
 * program starts (typically in the main()). Then, you can call
 * x_Step()/x_Set()/x_Get() every time as needed, typically in the control
 * functions called periodically (ctrl_RegulatePosition()...).
 * 
 * See the "Modules" section of this documentation to see how they work.
 *

 *  - TIM10: current loop.
 *  - TIM11: -
 *  - TIM12: -
 *  - TIM13: -
 *  - TIM14: -
 * \subsection stm32_resources_usage_adcs ADCs
 *  - ADC1: general purpose ADC.
 *  - ADC2: -
 *  - ADC3: motor current sensor ADC.
 * \subsection stm32_resources_usage_dac DAC
 *  - DAC: DAC extension.
 * \subsection stm32_resources_usage_buses Communication buses
 *  - USART1: UART extension.
 *  - USART2: USB communication UART.
 *  - I2C1: I2C extension.
 *  - SPI3: SPI extension.
