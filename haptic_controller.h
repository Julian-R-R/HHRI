 /** @defgroup HapticController Main / Haptic controller
   * @brief Main haptic paddle controller.
   *
   * This module is the high-level controller of the board. Basically, its role
   * is to process the sensors data and then compute a motor torque, in order to
   * achieve a spicific haptic effect.
   *
   * The content of hapt_Update() is typically what the user of the board will
   * modify, depending on the selected sensors and control algorithms.
   *
   * Call hapt_Init() to setup this module. Its interrupt function will be called
   * automatically periodically.
   *
