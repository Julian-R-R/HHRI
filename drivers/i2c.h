/** @defgroup I2C Driver / I2C
  * @brief Driver for the I2C bus communication peripheral.
  *
  * This driver controls the I2C peripheral of the STM32, that is accessible
  * from the digital extension connector of the HRI board.
  *
  * Call i2c_Init() first in the initialization code. Then, the communication
  * function i2c_readRegister() or i2c_writeRegister() can be used.
  * Note that both functions are synchronous, hence blocking the execution until
  * the operation completes.
