/** @defgroup Hall Driver / Hall sensor
  * @brief Driver for a Hall-effect angular sensor.
  *
  * This driver uses an ADC input, ANIN1 or ANIN2 (see ADC).
  * To use this, connect wire the sensor as this:
  * * hall red -> +5V (pin 1 or 5 of J2).
  * * hall yellow -> GND (pin 2 or 6 of J2).
  * * hall blue -> ANINX+ (pin 3 or 7 of J2).
  * * GND (pin 2 or 6 of J2) -> ANINX- (pin 4 or 8 of J2).
  *
  * Set the sensitivity switches to +-10V.
  *
  * Call hall_Init() first in the initialization code. Then, call hall_Get() to
  * get the angle of the paddle.
  *
