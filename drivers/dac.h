  * @brief Driver for the digital-to-analog converter.
  *
  * The STM32 features a two channels DAC, which means it is able to drive two
  * pins with an analog voltage. On the HRI board, this voltage is mulltiplied
  * by an amplification stage, so the final output range is +-9V. The
  * corresponding output pins are on the J1 connector: ANOUT1 (2) and ANOUT2 (4).
  *
  * In the initialization code, call dac_Init() once. Then call
  * dac_GetVoltageX() everytime the output voltage needs to be updated.
  *
